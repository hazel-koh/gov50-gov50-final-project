## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to compliance with International Court of Justice decisions. I would like to determine whether a state's level of democracy, their government's ideology, or their aggregate power has a treatment effect on their willingness to comply with the Court's decisions. I will decide which of these treatment variables I would like to focus on based on the data I'm able to find.
